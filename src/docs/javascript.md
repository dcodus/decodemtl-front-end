There are a few external scripts needed for typographic purposes:

#### Typography

- The DIN fonts are being called from [fonts.com](https://www.fonts.com/font/linotype/din-next). This script must be called in the head of the document:

```markup
<script type="text/javascript" src="//fast.fonts.net/jsapi/7adea19c-f46d-4bc4-9b49-417fc6633b72.js"></script>
```

#### Font Awesome (typographic icons)

- The site uses icons from [Font Awesome](fontawesome.io). Include this script in the header *before* calling our stylesheet:

```markup
<script src="https://use.fontawesome.com/071daf9e4e.js"></script>
```
